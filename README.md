# Parallel Sorting

This project contains the serial and parallel implements of several sort algorithms like Quicksort, Enumsort and Mergesort, and it use benchmark tests for these implements to compare the running time of them.

- This is the source codes of my programming assignment of PC2019 (Parallel computing - structures, algorithms, programming) courses.
